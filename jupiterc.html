    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>The Jupiter-C was an American sub-orbital (later orbital in the Juno I configuration) sounding rocket, measuring
        69.9 ft in height, 5.8 ft in width and 64,000 lbs in mass. It
        was derived from the PGM-11 Redstone missile, which was the first large, operational
        ballistic missile developed in the United States. It could have launched the first U.S. satellite on September
        20, 1956, with the launch of RS-27, in which it reached an altitude of 682 miles and flew 3,355 miles downrange,
        and reached a speed of Mach 18 (~13,811 mph; just 3689 mph short of orbital velocity); however, the Army had
        been forbidden from doing so, and hence filled the upper stage with sand to
        prevent accidental orbit. After the spectacular failure of Vanguard TV-3 on December 6, 1957, and the delay of
        Vanguard TV-3BU (originally scheduled for 22 January 1958; technical problems and poor weather delayed the
        launch until February 5; that rocket failed to reach orbit anyhow) a Juno I rocket (RS-29) placed the first U.S.
        artificial satellite, Explorer 1, in orbit on 31 January 1958.
